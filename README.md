sole's .vim dir
===============

This is my .vim directory put in a git repository since I saw more people doing it and I thought it was a terrific idea.

To install, clone the repo into your own .vim directory, like this:

	git clone git://github.com/sole/dotvim.git ~/.vim

You also have to make a symbolic link to .vim/vimrc and place it in ~/.vimrc. Or you can use the install_vimrc.sh script.

I am using my own color scheme (imaginatively named "sole"), which is still very rough because I just began learning about vim's color schemes yesterday.
So if you don't like it... well, there are many other themes out there!

## Inspirations/sources ##

These are my inspirations/sources of knowledge:

### Tsung-Hsiang (Sean) Chang's .vim ###
https://github.com/vgod/vimrc

I got the idea for the symlink to .vimrc here (and learnt that it has to be in ~/.vimrc)
