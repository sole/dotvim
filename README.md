This is my .vim directory put in a git repository since I saw more people doing it and I thought it was a terrific idea.

These are my inspirations/sources of knowledge:

Tsung-Hsiang (Sean) Chang's .vim
https://github.com/vgod/vimrc

I got the idea for the symlink to .vimrc here (and learnt that it has to be in ~/.vimrc)
